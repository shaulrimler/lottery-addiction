# Lottery Analysis
Analyzing the numbers around the chances of winning the 6/49 lottery.<br>
The 6/49 lottery dataset was pulled from Kaggle and is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datascienceai/lottery-dataset).<br>
Support for this project is courtesy of Dataquest. Additional analysis as well as helpful analogies were added by me.
